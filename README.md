## :rocket: Quick start 

Let's create a new project!

Navigate to your WordPress install's root folder and run the following command:

```
npx create-wp-project
```

Script will prompt you for theme name and local development url (used for BrowserSync) and install a new theme:

![](packages/create-wp-theme/setup.gif)

After the script is finished, you can activate the theme through WP Admin Dashboard. 

To start developing run this command from projects root folder:
```
npm start
```

## :interrobang: Plugin

When working for a client it may be easier to add every additional functionality to the theme. Since you are using namespaces, this contains all the necessary logic in the theme. You can use plugins of course, but be careful how you are adding extra functionality, so that you don't run in the dependency hell.
If you need to expose certain functionality across the multisite we recommend that you create a plugin.

Plugins should be created using plugin boilerplate, with addition of namespaces and autoloader. We have that also prepared so please check our [Eightshfit Boilerplate Plugin](https://github.com/infinum/eighshift-task-plugin).
