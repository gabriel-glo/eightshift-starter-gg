# Eightshift Starter Task
Your assignment will be to build your WordPress theme through a series of different tasks. It is designed to introduce you to Eightshift's way of working with WordPress projects.

Before you start working on this assignment, you should read these materials:
1. [WordPress Handbook](https://handbook.infinum.co/books/wordpress)
2. [Frontend Handbook](https://handbook.infinum.co/books/frontend)

Also, you will be working with these libs and should also read their Readme and Wiki materials:
1. [Eightshift Boilerplate Internal](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate-internal)
2. [Eightshift Libs](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs)
3. [Eightshift Blocks](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-blocks)
4. [Eightshift Frontend Libs](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-frontend-libs)

Now that you have all this knowledge in your head, this task should be relatively easy to complete. Good luck and feel free to ask you mentor if anything is not clear.

## Helpful references:

* [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/)
* [Gutenberg documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/)
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
* [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/)

## Pro tips
* Commit often.
* Write good commit messages.
* Read documentation and wiki before you start.
* Ask your mentor if you are stuck, don't waste an entire day.
* Documenting your code is important
* Lint all your code.


# Instructions
Everything needs to work in all major modern browsers and the latest mobile devices. You do not need to make them backward compatible with older IE browsers.

# 1. Setup your local development environment
This task is reasonably self-explanatory. To work with WordPress, you need to have some development environment on your computer (LAMP or LEMP stack).

We suggest working on VVV setup, as it comes with a lot of preinstalled tools you can use, but this is not mandatory. Use the environment that you feel most comfortable working on.

Details on different environments can be found in [WordPress Handbook](https://handbook.infinum.co/books/wordpress/Development%20environment/Setting%20up%20development%20environment)

# 2. Setup 
Follow the instructions in [internal Eightshift Boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate-internal) and set up your project.

# 3. Implement the provided design
Design and all assets for your assignment are in this [folder](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-starter-task/tree/master/task). Style them and implement them using Gutenberg dynamic blocks. 

# 4. Lint your code
Linting is very important for code quality and code consistency. You can't push any changes to Github that are not linted and valid.

# 5. QA
Once you are happy with the project, go to the QA team on the 7th floor and test your project on multiple devices. You can use browser-sync features for this.

You should test on:
* Latest Android Device
* Latest iOS Device
* Firefox
* Chrome
* Windows IE 11
* Windows Edge

Alternatively, you can use [https://www.browserstack.com/](https://www.browserstack.com/), you will find the login credentials in 1Pass.

 If everything is working correctly, you are ready to work on more significant projects.
